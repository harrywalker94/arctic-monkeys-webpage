# User Centric Frontend Development - Arctic Monkeys Band Web Page

This is a project I have built based on the band 'Arctic Monkeys'.

# UX

The main aim of my website was to provide the user with images, videos, news and history regarding the band. I used a mainly black/white/grey theme to try and represent the bands 'indie' and 'rock' feel.

I wanted to make the website easy for the user to navigatte, hence why I have created a user friendly design and included links to other pages on the website for the user to view different content of the band. I have also included external social links to the bands social media pages which includes Instagram, Facebook and Twitter as well as links the listen and buy music via Apple Music, Spotify and YouTube.

# Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Boostrap (v4.3.1)

# Features
1. The site features a parallax scrolling effect on all pages with a fixed top navbar, with links to other pages on the site (collapsable into navbar icon on small devices), as well as a fixed bottom navbar with social links (using Font Awesome icons).
2. Tour - The tour page features iframes with videos from youtube of the band playing at live shows. It also includes a table with a mock-up band European Tour dates, which I used influence from previous European tours and venues.
3. Gallery - The gallery page features an image carousel which I have taken from Bootstrap which features images of the bands history. I have also included images of the band below which expand when hovering.
4. Music - The music page includes the 6 feature, studio albums the band has created, with links to the official Arctic Monkeys website when clicked upon, if you wish to buy.
5. News - The news page includes cards which offer headlines and links to offical online news outlets, which have featured stories on the band. At the bottom of the page it offers a mock-up email submission for users to enter their email address and subscribe to news letters for the future.

Some images/videos collapse into single columns on smaller devices rather than multi-columns on medium and larger devices, making it more user friendly.

## Features left to implement
In the future, I would like to include a backend where the user can submit their email address and subscribe to a real news letter.

I would also like to include animations in the future.

# Testing 
The webstie provides my intended outcome of giving the user the options to view various images/videos/information/history of the band. They are able to view the bands offical website by clicking on the band albums links as well as all social icons which I have used font awesome icons to implement. 

If the user tries to submit their email with an invalid email address, there will be an error noting the email address is invalid.

All the social and external links will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank"'.

The website was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and on mobile devices (iPhone 5/SE, iPhone 6/7/8, iPhone 6/7/8 plus, iPhone X/XS, Galaxy S5, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, iPad, iPad pro to ensure compatability and responsiveness. 

On smaller devices, the parallax scrolling effect did not seem to work and the images were far too large for the user to view, therefore I removed it and instead used images which fit the screen on smaller devices.

# Deployment
The website is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html.

You can run this deployed site at: https://harrywalker94.github.io/arctic-monkeys-webpage/index.html

To run  this site locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting __git clone https://harrywalker94.github.io/arctic-monkeys-webpage/index.html__ into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type __git remote rm origin__ into the terminal.
